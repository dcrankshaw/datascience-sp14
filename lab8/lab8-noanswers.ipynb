All of the frameworks that we've used so far (e.g., [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), R) are designed to be run on a single computer.  However, many data sets today are too large to be stored on a single computer.  Even when a dataset can be stored on one computer, the data set can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark is designed for this purpose: it allows you to concisely describe a program to analyze data on many computers, and hides many of the details of coordinating data analysis on many machines.\n",

When you run `count()` on a dataset, one task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine.  In this example, the dataset is broken into 4 partitions, so 4 `count()` tasks are launched.\n",

      "### Data Parallel Operations\n",
      "\n",
      "Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the data set\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can easily parallelize the operation: each task does the \"something\" to it's own partition of the dataset. `map(f)` is one such example: it applies a function `f` to each item in the dataset, and outputs the resulting dataset.  When we run `map(f)` with Spark, each task applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition.  We'll use `map(f)` to convert the ratings dataset to a format that's a little easier to manipulate.  Having \"`::`\"-separated strings for each data item is not very convenient; let's convert the input data into tuples: `(UserID, MovieID, Rating, Timestamp)`, and convert the IDs, ratings, and timestamps to appropriate data types.  The figure below shows how this would work on the smaller data set from the earlier figures.  Note that one task is launched for each partition.\n",

As an example of a join, let's compute the number of times that each movie was rated.  First, we'll compute the number of times that each movie was rated using the ratings dataset, and then we'll use a join to get the movie names from the movies dataset."
