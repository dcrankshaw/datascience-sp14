# Tabular data processing with Pandas

In this lab exercise we will look at how to work with data stored in a tabular
form and perform exploratory data analysis on it. We will be using the Python Data
Analysis Library or [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to do this.

## Introducing Pandas

The two main data structures that Pandas supports are Series and DataFrames.
Series are one-dimensional data structures that are a collection of any data
type. DataFrames on the other hand are two dimensional data structures which
resemble a database table or say an Excel spreadsheet. In this lab we will
primarily be using DataFrames and will look at operations that we can perform
using them.

Before you start, download the following file to your home directory (i.e
`/home/saasbook`) and unzip it.

    wget https://raw.github.com/amplab/datascience-sp14/master/lab2/data/wc_day6_1_sample.tar.bz2
    tar -xf wc_day6_1_sample.tar.bz2

After that run `ipython notebook` from your command line. This
will launch a browser window with the `iPython Dashboard`. [IPython
notebook](http://ipython.org/) provides an interactive environment for
using Python. Click on `New Notebook` to create a new notebook.
We'll first import `pylab`, a library that supports plotting and direct plots to be
shown line. Next we will import the Pandas library and create a simple DataFrame, 
by running

    from pylab import *
    %matplotlib inline
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame( { 'a' : [1, 2, 3, 4], 'b': [ 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'] })

NOTE: In the iPython notebook you'll need to use `Cntrl + Enter` or click the
play button to execute code in a cell.

If you need clarifications about the Pandas API you can type the function name
followed by `?` to get inline help. For example to get help with the above call
run:

    pd.DataFrame?

If you want to see the same in a browser lookup the function in the [API
documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html).

## DataFrame basics

The simplest way to see what is in a DataFrame is to just print it to the
console. For example to see the DataFrame we created before you can just type
`df` and see something like

    df
       a  b
    0  1  w
    1  2  x
    2  3  y
    3  4  z

    [4 rows x 2 columns]

This shows that we have two columnns 'a' and 'b' and four rows in our DataFrame.

However large DataFrames cannot be printed to the console and we have higher
level commands to inspect its contents. To get information on the schema of the
DataFrames, we can use the `info` function

    df.info()

    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    Int64Index: 4 entries, 0 to 3
    Data columns (total 2 columns):
    a    4  non-null values
    b    4  non-null values
    dtypes: int64(1), object(1)

To see the first few rows you can use `head` and to see the last few rows you
can use `tail`. This is similar to the UNIX-command line tools (Remember Lab 1 !?)

    In [31]: df.head(2)
    Out[31]:
       a  b
    0  1  w
    1  2  x

    [2 rows x 2 columns]

To print any range of rows from the DataFrame you can use array-like indexing of
row ids. As you might have noticed rows are numbered from 0 in Pandas, so to get
the middle two rows we can use the range `1:3`

    In [34]: df[1:3]
    Out[34]:
       a  b
    1  2  x
    2  3  y

    [2 rows x 2 columns]


Finally, Pandas also has a useful function `describe` that summarizes the
contents of numerical columns in a DataFrame. For example in `df` we can see the
mean, standard deviation etc. for the column `a` by running `describe`.

    In [42]: df.describe()
    Out[42]:
                  a
    count  4.000000
    mean   2.500000
    std    1.290994
    min    1.000000
    25%    1.750000
    50%    2.500000
    75%    3.250000
    max    4.000000

    [8 rows x 1 columns]

Having worked our way through the basics, lets now see how we can use
Pandas for data analysis. To do this part of the lab we will reuse the World Cup
soccer logs from Lab 1. However this time the input data has been sampled and
formatted as a `csv` file that you will load first.

    log_df = pd.read_csv("/home/saasbook/wc_day6_1_sample.csv",
                         names=['ClientID', 'Date', 'Time', 'URL', 'ResponseCode', 'Size'],
                         na_values=['-'])

The `names` argument tells Pandas what the column names are in our file and
`na_values` indicates what character is used for missing values in our dataset.
Use the commands from the previous section to explore the dataset and its
summary statistics.

#### DIY
1. How many rows are present in `log_df` ?
2. What are the URLs between rows 85 and 90 ?

## SQL-like operators

Next we will look at operators in Pandas that allow us to perform SQL-like
queries on the dataset.

### Selection
A SQL statement typically selects a subset of rows from a table that match a
given criteria. This is known as the
[Selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_(relational_algebra))
operator in Relational Algebra. Similarly we can perform selections in
Pandas using boolean indexing.

Boolean indexing refers to a technique where you can use a list of boolean
values to filter a DataFrame. For example lets say we only want entries from
'01/May/1998'. To do this we can create a boolean list like

    is_may1st = log_df['Date'] == '01/May/1998'
    is_may1st.head(2)
    0    False
    1    False
    Name: Date, dtype: bool

Now we can filter our DataFrame by passing it the boolean list.

    may1_df = log_df[is_may1st]
    may1_df.head()

Or we can directly do this by passing in the boolean clause to the DataFrame

    may1_df = log_df[log_df['Date'] == '01/May/1998']
    may1_df.head()

### Projection
While selection is used for filtering rows,
[projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(relational_algebra)) is the
relational algebra operator used to select columns. To do this with Pandas we
just need to pass in a list of columns that we wish to select. For example to
only keep the 'URL' and 'ResponseCode' column we would run

    url_codes = log_df[['URL', 'ResponseCode']]
    url_codes.head(5)

### Grouping
Pandas also allows you to group the DataFrame by values in any column. For
example to group requests by 'ResponseCode' you can run

    grouped = log_df.groupby('ResponseCode')
    grouped
    <pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy object at 0xbda56ec>

As you can see from the output above, `grouped` is not a `DataFrame` but an object
of type `DataFrameGroupBy`. This just means that it contains a number of groups
and each group is in turn a DataFrame. To see this try

    grouped.ngroups
    grouped.groups.keys()
      [400.0, 200.0, 302.0, 304.0, 404.0, 206.0, 500.0]
    grouped.get_group(200).head()
       ClientID         Date      Time                                    URL ResponseCode
    0      1044  30/Apr/1998  22:46:12                      /images/11104.gif          200
    1     10871  01/May/1998  12:10:53                      /images/ligne.gif          200
    2     11012  01/May/1998  12:17:30  /english/individuals/player111503.htm          200
    5     13649  01/May/1998  14:55:01                 /images/hm_anime_e.gif          200
    6     15006  01/May/1998  16:14:32  /english/images/comp_bu_group_off.gif          200

You can also group by multiple columns by just passing the a list of column
names. For example to group by both date and response code you can run

    multi_grouped = log_df.groupby(['ResponseCode', 'Date'])

Pandas also has [useful
commands](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/groupby.html) to print
various statistics about elements in each group.

0. `grouped.describe()` prints summary statistics for numeric columns in each group
1. `grouped.size()` prints the number of elements in each group
2. Similarly `grouped.sum()`, `grouped.mean()` and `grouped.median()` print the sum,
mean and median values for numeric columns in each group

### Other SQL operators
We have only looked at the basic SQL operators so far. Pandas also supports
operations like `sort`, `join` and `indexing` to support a wide-range of
queries. You can read more about this and try out examples with the [Pandas
comparison to SQL](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html)

#### DIY
1. Lab 1 Deja vu ! Use selection to print the number of requests that had HTTP return code 404.
2. How many of them were on 30th April and how many on 1st May ? Hint: Use the `multi_grouped`
DataFrame we created above.

## Applying functions to rows, column
So far we have been using SQL-style operators to process our data. However to do
data cleaning or more complex analysis we often need to apply functions on row or column of a DataFrame.

For example, consider the columns 'Date' and 'Time' in our Dataframe. uld
be useful if we could combine these columns and create `datetimects then
it would be useful for filtering, grouping etc.

To create a `DateTime` column we will use Pandas helper function `to_datetime`.
This function takes a string and converts it to a `datetime` object. To call
this on every row of the DataFrame, we use the `apply` function. `apply` takes
two arguments, the first a function to apply and secondly `axis` which indicates
if this should be applied on every row (axis=1) or column (axis=0)

    log_df['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(log_df.apply(lambda row: row['Date'] + ' ' + row['Time'], axis=1))

This might take a minute to run as we are adding a new column for every request
in our table. Meanwhile take a look at the various components of `DateTime`
objects in the [API documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#time-date-components)
For example if we want to group by hour we can now use the DateTime API instead of
doing any string parsing.

    hour_grouped = log_df.groupby(lambda row: log_df['DateTime'][row].hour)
    hour_grouped.ngroups

Finally, note that you can apply operations on each group using the `apply`
method. This is similar to the `apply` on the DataFrame we saw earlier except
the `apply` method is now called *once per group*.

#### DIY
1. Create a new column that contains the ResponseSize in kilo bytes.

## Plotting data in a DataFrame
In a future lab exercise we will look at plotting in greater detail. However we
can produce simple plots using the Python `matplotlib` library with a DataFrame.
For example to plot a Series or a DataFrame you can just
call `plot()` on the object and for a histogram just call `hist()`

    rand_df = pd.DataFrame({'a' : randn(100)})
    rand_df.plot()
    rand_df.hist()

## Exercises
1. What is the average file size for images (.gif or .jpg or .jpeg files) which
had response code 200 ? What is the standard deviation ?
2. Generate a histogram of traffic to the site every *half-hour* and plot this.

## Challenge exercises (Optional)

1. We wish to see if there is any correlation between client-ids and hours of
the day at which they visit the website. Get 100 random client ids from the dataset and
plot a scatter plot that shows the hours of the day these clients sent requests.

2. The log file used in the lab was from one day of the WorldCup. Lets apply our
analysis to another day's logs. For this start with the raw log file
`https://raw.github.com/amplab/datascience-sp14/master/lab2/data/wc_day91_1_log.tar.bz2` from
github and load it as a Pandas DataFrame. Repeat the first 2 exercises with it.
How similar or different are the results ?
Hint: You can use UNIX command line tools from Lab 1 to first get a csv file and
then load it into Pandas.
