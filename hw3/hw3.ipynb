      "# Homework 3: Predicting Movie Ratings\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most common uses of data is to predict what users want.  Predicting what users want allows websites to make more money by displaying more relevant ads, allows advertisers to make more money by targeting interested users, and allows online stores to make more money by recommending products to users.  While you may not like the idea of advertisers and stores figuring out what you want to make more money, it can also be useful to you as a consumer.  Sometimes those recommended products on Amazon or recommended movies on Netflix are actually things that you want!\n",

      "Before jumping into the machine learning, you need to break up the dataset into a test set (which we'll use to train models), a validation set (which we'll use to choose the best model), and a test set.  One way that people often partition data is using the time stamp: using the 1's digit of the timestamp is an essentially random way to split the dataset into multiple groups.  Use the 1's digit of the rating timestamp to separate 60% of the data into a training set, 20% into a validation set, and the remaining 20% into a test set.  After creating each dataset, use Spark's `repartition(numPartitions)` function (which re-partitions the dataset into the specified number of partitions) to break each dataset into the optimal number of partitions (which you determined in part 2)."
